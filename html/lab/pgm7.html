	<h2>About The College</h2>
		<p>St. George's College Aruvithura is a college under Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam. It is located in Aruvithura, Erattupetta, Kottayam District in Kerala, India. It was reaccredited with 'A++' Grade by NAAC for seven years in the fourth cycle.

St. George’s College Aruvithura, is a minority educational institution founded by St. George Forane Church, Aruvithura in 1965. Pioneered under the patronage of His Excellency Mar Sebastian Vayalil, the first Bishop of Pala, and cherished by a host of visionaries and philanthropists like Very Rev. Fr. Thomas Araythinal and Mr T. A. Thomman (Former Minister), the college, right from its inception, embarked on an odyssey towards academic pre-eminence. Very Rev. Fr. Thomas Manakkat, the founding manager and a great visionary, was truly instrumental in laying the foundations for a great beginning and Very Rev. Fr. Jacob Thazhathel, who followed him, was equally adept and insightful in his ideals, guiding the college during the early stages of its growth. For more than two decades, His Excellency Mar Joseph Pallickaparampil, the Bishop of Pala, had been the patron of the college. His Excellency Mar Joseph Kallarangattu is the present patron of this seat of learning.

Currently, the college offers 17 undergraduate courses, and 5 postgraduate courses and the Department of Chemistry and Physics are recognized Research Centers under MG University.</p>
